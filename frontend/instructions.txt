This is the frontend directory for the project.

All frontend-related code should be placed here, including:
- UI components and pages (Next.js app)
- Stylesheets and static assets
- Feature-specific components and logic

Recommended structure:
  /app           # Next.js app directory (pages, layouts, etc.)
  /components    # Reusable UI components
  /features      # Feature-specific UI and logic
  /public        # Static assets (images, icons, etc.)
  /styles        # CSS/SCSS or Tailwind config

To get started:
1. Install dependencies with `npm install` (run this command inside the frontend directory).
2. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
3. Add or edit components, pages, and styles as needed.

Keep all frontend code and dependencies inside this directory.
