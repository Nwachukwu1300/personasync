This is the backend directory for the project.

You can add all backend-related code here, such as:
- API endpoints (e.g., using Express, Fastify, or another framework)
- Database models and connection logic
- Controllers, services, and utilities
- Integrations with external APIs or services

Recommended structure:
  /controllers   # Business logic for each feature
  /models        # Database schemas/models
  /routes        # API route definitions
  /services      # External API integrations
  /utils         # Helper functions

To get started:
1. Choose your backend framework (e.g., Express, Fastify, etc.).
2. Initialize a new Node.js project here with `npm init -y`.
3. Install your dependencies (e.g., `npm install express`).
4. Create your main server file (e.g., `index.js` or `server.js`).
5. Add your API routes and logic as needed.

Keep all backend code and dependencies inside this directory.
